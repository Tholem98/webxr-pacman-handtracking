# WebXR Pacman

Prototype of Pacman game in WebXR (mixed reality). Built using Three.js.

Place the game on any flat horizontal surface. You can then move around the game in 3D (move closer/further, rotate around the game).

## Demo

## Gameplay

Because of the current restrictions of WebXR, the gameplay is not as clear as I'd like.

To move Pacman up/down/left/right, you need to touch your phone's screen at certain coordinates:

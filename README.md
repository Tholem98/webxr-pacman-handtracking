# WebXR Pac-Man

Prototype of Pac-Man game in WebXR (mixed reality). Built using Three.js.

[Live demo](https://webxr-pacman.netlify.app)

Place the game on any flat horizontal surface. You can then move around the game in 3D (move closer/further, rotate around the game).

## Gameplay

Because of the current restrictions of WebXR, the gameplay is not as clear as I'd like.

To move Pacman up/down/left/right, you need to touch your phone's screen at certain coordinates:

Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/charliegerard/webxr-pacman). So I take it with a fork, I don't know if it was right
